  As the coronavirus continues to spread across the country, businesses have been hurting. This is particularly evident in industries where employees cannot do their job from home, such as workers in food-service, outdoor work, and various other jobs. Unfortunately, whenever these employees catch the virus, or have been in contact with it, they must be quarantined for two weeks, and businesses are now faced with the problem with quickly finding a replacement for a time-span of only two weeks. In order to ease the stress of this process, we have come up with this solution.
  
  SUB-ME solves the problem of sick or quarantined employees by offering a platform for businesses to post brief job listings as soon as they need someone to fill in while their employee is out. Additionally, SUB-ME offers a platform for people who have recently been layed off due to the pandemic, or anyone who is in need of a temporary job and need some type of income while searching for a steady job. These job listings will be brief and the jobs themselves won't last for very long. Furthermore, listings are organized based on keyword searches and the location of the prospective temporary employee. Job listings will also provide certifications that prospective workers must have. Once an employee applies for a job that meets the certifications, they can be contacted by the account manager of the company. SUB-ME's purpose is to help alleviate the pressure that the coronavirus pandemic has had on businesses dealing with quarantined employees.
