  As the corona virus continues to spread across the country, businesses have been hurting. This is particularly evident in industries where employees cannot do their job from home, such as cashiers, hospital workers, and warehouse workers. Unfortunately, whenever these employees catch the virus, or have been in contact with it, they must be quarantined for two weeks. This makes it especially hard for a business who has just lost an employee for these two weeks. In order to ease the stress of struggling without this employee for two weeks, we have come up with an solution.
  
  SUB-ME solves the problem of sick or quarantined employees by offering a platform for businesses to post brief job listings as soon as they need someone to fill in while their employee is out. Additionally, SUB-ME offers a platform for people who have recently been layed off due to the pandemic and need some type of income while searching for a steady job. These job listings will be brief and the jobs themselves will be temporary.
